## Key Findings

### 1. Traditional ML vs Deep Learning
- Traditional ML models (especially Gradient Boosting) significantly outperform deep learning models on this dataset
- The relatively small dataset size (1,596 samples) may limit the effectiveness of deep learning approaches
- Tree-based models better capture the non-sequential nature of weather regulation patterns

### 2. Among Deep Learning Models
- **Best Performing**: CNN (F1=0.830) and FNN (F1=0.807)
- **Moderate Performance**: RNN-based models (LSTM, GRU, RNN, Attention-LSTM) all achieve similar F1 scores around 0.674-0.678
- **Transformer Performance**: Despite being state-of-the-art for many tasks, the Transformer performs similarly to RNNs (F1=0.674)

### 3. Threshold Optimization
- All RNN-based models and Transformer optimal threshold is 0.10, indicating they struggle with class separation
- CNN and FNN have more reasonable thresholds (0.35 and 0.45), suggesting better calibration

### 4. Model Characteristics
- **CNN**: Best at capturing spatial patterns in weather features
- **FNN**: Effective for direct feature-to-output mapping without temporal dependencies
- **RNN-based models**: Struggle with the small sequence length and dataset size
- **Transformer**: May be overly complex for this dataset size

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Use**: Stick with Gradient Boosting (F1=0.879) or Random Forest (F1=0.835)
2. **If Deep Learning is Required**: Use CNN for its superior performance among DL models
3. **Data Requirements**: Deep learning models would likely benefit from:
   - Larger dataset (10,000+ samples)
   - Longer sequence lengths for temporal models
   - Additional feature engineering

## Technical Details

### Training Configuration
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate 0.001
- **Loss Function**: Binary crossentropy
- **Callbacks**: Early stopping, learning rate reduction
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Max Epochs**: 30 (most models stopped early)

### Computational Requirements
- All models trained on CPU
- Training time: 1-5 minutes per model
- Memory usage: < 2GB

## Conclusion

While deep learning models show promise, traditional machine learning approaches (particularly ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting) remain superior for this weather regulation prediction task. The structured, tabular nature of weather data and the relatively small dataset size favor traditional ML algorithms over deep learning approaches.
